The factions of Hell are always battling for power and control, often encouraged by other realms beyond the mortal plans such as the divine because if they were to join forces then it would spell doom for all of existance. So when such fiendish battles spilled into Cliffmond it through the city into a panic. Eliza lead the charge on relief efforts, gathering civilians together for safety, ordering guards to defend any camps they could, and devising a plan with any adventurers willing to help.

As the inital chaos settled, it was releaved that the commander was killed in the invasion, that two fiendish factions have claimed portions of the city as their own, angelic forces have also established a foothold, and that the city appears to be surrounded by the undead. The only other Watch Captain confirmed to be alive was Sylvester, but he was keen to let Eliza take charge.

Eliza pushed herself through the siege, securing resources and defenses, organizing rations and battle plans, and acting as a symbol of stability. When there was opportunities to negotiate with fiend or angel forces, she did what she could to save the city. She eventually joined the adventurers on a mission to remove a fiendish faction from the city, which was successful but left her injured. 

During her recovery, a deal was struck so that the remaining fiendish forces began to march on the angels, who in turn were marching on the remaining civilians in order to remove any obstacles from their ultimate goal. Eliza held her ground despite her injuries, and managed to buy enough time for reinforcements to arrive and even managed to slay one of the angelic commanders in the fight. While the adventures managed to finally dispell the remaining conflict and remove the undead surrounding the city, Eliza finally managed to get some rest.
