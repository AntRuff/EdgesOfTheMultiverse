Watch Captain: a title given to only the most elite of the Cliffmond city guard, and one only outranked by the commander themself. Watch Captains were of the few within the guard who could handle the most vile of monsters and the powerful adventurers who overstepped their authority.

Eliza earned that title after 40 years of service. She was a skilled fencer with over a hundred years of training, both in her Elvish home city of Solglade and in during her travels in her mid 200s. She eventually decided to remain in Cliffmond, joining the city guard and working her way through the ranks.

It was after ataining the title of Watch Captain, during what seemed to be an abduction in progress did she cross paths with an old organization known as the Blood Farm. They were, among other things, a trafficking ring thought to have gone out of buisness long ago. One that Eliza barely escaped from 150 years ago, at the cost of an arm and a friend.

Trauma long thought buried surfaced as she struggled to work the case, uncoving that the organization had laid low for some time to allow their vampiric leader Calec to grow in power and influence. Eventually, Eliza managed to overcome her old captor and pin him down with silvered blades long enough for the sun to rise on a new day.
