# Edges of the Multiverse
This project is a mod for Sentinels of the Multiverse.

As the multiverse continues to grow, so too do the stories held within. These are the stories from the far reaches of the multiverse, ones where the heroes, villians, and even the world itself differs greatly from what we know. Explore powerful magic, strange new worlds, and battle great evils at _The Edges of the Multiverse._

Currently only the Hero Eliza, Watch Captain of Cliffmond is available. Variants should be released shortly.
